        <p id="text1">
            The Meiji Restoration was the major political revolution in the Japan that happened to 1868, 
            it started after the Tokugawa Shogunate, which at that time was the military that ruled Japan. 
            This mark in history ended the Edo period. After the Tokugawa Shogunate, the rule of the country was given to Mutsuhito, 
            Meiji Tenno, who was an imperial ruler. Even though this was the main part of the Meiji Restoration,
            the bigger picture is the political, economic and social changes that started following the event.
            Meiji Restoration was a revolution that got modernization, globalization and Westernization.

                </center>
        <img id="image2" src="China-Britan War.jpg">
        <p id="text1">In 1839 and 1856. Asian Nations were shocked when Britain crushed China in the two Opium Wars. It was clear the industrialization gave a lot of advantage to the European Nations, that included money and weapons. China was the strongest nation in Asia, but the British navy destroyed them with their "better weapons", even with fewer military.

                The wars showed that China had fallen behind the Britain. Japan was intended on not falling behind the British. This caused the Meiji Restoration in 1868. It was a political change that took Western models and Japanese Tradition into consideration to create a new political system. This made Japan a nation that could stand in front of the European Nations in military and economic power.
                
                In the 19th century, an emperor had been ruling over Japan for around 1,500 years. But from 1185 to 1868, the emperor had very little power. The actual powers was contained by the shogunate, which was a government run by a shogun. The shogun was a military leader, similar to a dictator, who held all the powers. The emperor on the other hand reigned as a "God on Earth", he was just a religious figurehead.

        <img id="image1" src="Tokugawa Shogunate.jpeg">
        <p id="text1">Japan was furthermore divided into different regions, out of which each of them was controlled by a daimyo. Daimyo were fuedel lords, who controlled their lands with the help of samurais. Samurais were the military class who were given land in return for the military service they gave to the daimyo.
                
            The Tokugawa family was in control of the shogunate around 1600. The Tokugawa shogunate made strong control with the local daimyo. They enforced tradional, confucian policies. Confucian policies are the policies that were originated from China. This restricted peasants, around 80% of them, from working in any other job than farming. The Tokugawa were also extremely suspicious of European Influence. In 1636, the shogun made the "Act of Seclusion". This act made it illegal for western traders to trade in Japan. An exception were the Dutch, who were given a single post at Nagasaki, but they were still given suspicion. The act allowed Japanese merchants to trade with China and Korea, but still the achievement of putting the Japanese from the Europeans was achieved.

        <img id="image2" src="Samurais.jpeg">
        <p id="text1">The people who led the Meiji Restoration were majorly young samurai from the feudal domains, or the Hans. These samurais were hostile to the Tokugawa men. The noticeable samurai in the Meiji Restoration were Chosu, Honshu, and Satsuma. They were wary of the domestic problems that had been increasing at the time as well as the probability of the foreigners invading the country. Later on the main efforts went by the fact that Western Powers could "open" Japan. In 1850, the Tokugawa had been in power for 200 years. That time globalization was an upcoming topic, hence the majority of the countries were in isolation, including Japan. 
        They were scared that imperial pressure to increase similar to the one happening in China at that time. Their ideology was that the West depended on constitution for national unity for industrialization for material strength, that would eventually lead to a well-trained military for the security of the nation. They then started chanting the slogan "Enrich the country, strengthen the army", they wanted to create Japan powers and constitution that was equivalent tp the Western powers, face to face.

        <h2 id="head4" class="subtitle">Challenges Faced</h2>
        </center>
        <img id="image2" src="Challenges.webp">
        <p id="text1">The restoration leaders, who acted as the emperor, faced a lot of opposition in the mid-1870s. Angry samurais took action in several rebellions against the government. One of the famous government leaders was the former restoration hero Saigo Takamori of Satsuma. The uprising was oppressed only with great difficulty by the newly formed army. Peasant also weren't trusting the government, didn't trust the new regime and were dissatisfied with the new agrarian policies, then the peasants also took part in revolts that reach its peak in the 1880s.

        <img id="image1" src="Constitution.jpeg">
        <p id="text1">In 1885 a cabinet was form that started to begin its work in 1886. In the 1889, the constitution was officially announced to the citizens of Japan. It was given as a gift to the people from the emperor, from the pressure from the citizens. This couldn't be changed without the imperial taking action. Ito Hirobumi created the bicameral parliament. It was known as the "Diet". Bicameral parliaments is a parliament that is split into 2 houses or chambers, and both the houses have to agree if a change in the country is required. The Diet would be elected by a limited voting franchise.
            Limited Voting is when there are fewer votes per person than the amount of seats being voted for. Example is a person is given 1 vote, even though the election is for 3 seats. In 1890 the Diet assembled together. They could advise the emperor, and they contained actual powers.

            <img src="Charter Oath.webp" id="image2">
        <p id="text1">The goals of the first governments were told in the Charter Oath, which was declared in 1868. The Charter Oath committed the government into establishing "deliberative assemblies" and "public discussions", that would eventually help into a world-side search for knowledge. One of the first actions taken was in 1868, when the country was yet to settle. They wanted to relocate the imperial capital from Kyoto to the shogunal capital od Edo, this area was afterward renamed to Tokyo.

        <img id="image1" src="Charter Oath2.png">
        <p id="text1"> 
            This action was taken after the fight between them ended.
            This caused in the removal of the old feudal system in Japan, which gave ample of space for the reorganization of the system. These systems discarded the feudal class privilege.
            Later on a national army was formed that strengthen with the help of the universal conscription law. The conscription law is when any male or refugee in a country is mandated to work in a national service, mostly the military for a fixed duration. The new government also added many new policies that helped strengthen the monetary and text system. Many Westernizations were done as well, for example the universal education system was put in place, that emphasized on Western learning.</p>

            <h2 id="head9" class="subtitle">Propagandas During Meiji</h2>
        </center>
        <img src="Propaganda.jpeg" id="image1">
        <p id="text1">
            The propaganda created by the Japanese were meant to be against the Westerns. Especially the Anglo-Saxon, a culture that originated from England. The people who fell for the propaganda perceived themselves as giving a Japanese way of living, which is way different from the lives of Western imperialism. The propaganda made the West look weak. The Image says "With the help of Japan, China, and Manchukuo, the world can be at peace." This is a classic propaganda in the Japan, as it doesn't get the West into the picture directly, but makes it seem as if these 3 countries are the strongest power in the world. This makes the citizens of Japan believe that the Meiji Restoration, the government, has made Japan the best it could be.

            <h2 id="head7" class="subtitle">Occupation of Japan</h2>
            </center>
            <img id="image2" src="Occupation Map.jpeg">
            <p id="text1">The occupation of Japan happened during 1945-52. The "Allied Powers" took military occupation in Japan, after Japan was defeated in WWII. It was in theory an international occupation even tho most of the occupation was done by the US forces. In the occupation Japanese soldiers and civilians in foreign countries were taken back to Japan, many arms industries in Japan were removed, and political prisoners were freed from prisons. Wartime leaders in Japan faced war crime charges, out of which 7 were executed. A new constitution was created, making Japan a democratic country containing a democratic government.
                These actions replaced the Meiji Constitution. The emperor's power was decreased to a ceremonial status, and finally women were given the right to vote.

            <p id="text1">
                The occupation also got land reform, decreasing the farmers who were tenants from 46% to 10%. They also began to breakup cartels and trusts in Japan. Labour Unions were encouraged, but the fear of organizations that opposed the social hierarchy grew with the Cold War, stronger governmental was labor was supported. The education in Japan was seen as if it was only for the rich people, but it was remade similar to the US education system. Even though the US wanted to end the occupation in 1947, the  peace treaty was signed in 1951, and finally the occupation ended.

                The Meiji Restoration had a big effect at its time, giving Japan a constitution as well as removing the Tokugawa Shogunate of power. It played a big role at its time, but unfortunately it has little to none effect on Japan in the current world. This happened due to the defeat of the Japanese Empire in WWII, after the Hiroshima Nagasaki attack. This started the "Occupation of Japan". The occupation made major changes to the political, educational and agricultural systems in Japan. Even the constitution of Meiji was changed. This means that all the changes the Meiji Restoration made were meaningless after the Occupation.
